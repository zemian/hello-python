# Programming is a process of writing code to control the computer.
#   code = software = program = instructions
# We control the computer to process data.
#   data = words = numbers = math homeworks = our world!
# We write code using a computer language, eg: Python!
# A programming language has certain syntax, keywords and style in writing code.
#	syntax = grammar!
#   keywords = sight words!
#   style = cheese only please!
