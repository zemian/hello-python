tkinter = TK Interface
https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/tkinter.html

NOTE: turtle is built using tkinter!

I also found a good tutorial site on tkinter: http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/
But the code examples are written in Python 2, so we need to fix some minor
places to get it to work on Python 3.
