# Python Lesson: More on while vs for loop, and NEW LINE characters

# == NEW LINE characters
# Eeach print() will print the value passed to it, and a NEW LINE character
# automatically.
print(99)
print("Hello")

# What is a NEW LINE characters? It's a special character that 
# will insert a BLANK LINE in your output.
print("Hello\n")
print("Hello\n\n")
print("\nHello")

# The print() itself will automatically use "\n" at the end! To change this,
# you need to explicitly pass the parameter
print("Hello", end="")
print("Hello", end="\n")
print()

# You can print multiple variables or values at the same time,
# and they can be all different types. They each separated by comma.
# NOTE: This is often used to troubleshooting (or we call debugging), 
# when we want to see what happen inside code to print out variables.
print(11, "Kenny", 3.14, "Circle")


# == How to break out of loop EARLY
# Both while and for loop can exit early in your code block immediately with
# a keyword "break". This will skip remaining of the code block in your loop!

# While example:
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
	counter = counter + 1
	if counter >= 5:
		break
	print(counter, end=' ')
print()	

# A for loop examples works the same
mylist = list('Kenny')
for character in mylist:
	if character == 'n':
		break
	print(character, end=' ')
print()

# == Skiping part of code in loop, but continue til end
# Sometimes we want complete the loop, but skip portion of the code block.
# in this case, you can tell the codeblock to "continue" to next
# iteration/walk of the loop

# While loop example:
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
	counter = counter + 1
	if counter % 2 == 0:
		continue
	print(counter, end=' ')
print()

# Same can be done with for loop
mylist = list('Kenny')
for character in mylist:
	if character in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
		continue
	print(character, end=' ')
print()

# == Exercise Assignment
# 1) For each word in a list, print the number of vowels and consonants it has.
# word_list = ['civic', 'eat', 'radar', 'level', 'madam', 'fun']
# 2) Print each words above with double space (2 NEWLINES between words)
# 3) Print all words above in one line with one space between
