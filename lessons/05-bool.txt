# Python Lesson: Boolean, None, and If/Else
#
# == Boolean values
# A boolean is a special type that can only hold two values: True or False
flag = True
print(flag)
flag = False
print(flag)

# Python has a special value called None that means NOTHING! and this
# can also be treated as "False" condition. But it's NOT called a boolean!
myvar = None
if myvar:
	print("Not going to print!")

# == Comparators: in, <=, >=, <, >, and, or, not 
num = 99
print(num < 100) 
print(num > 100) 
print(num >= 99) 
print(num <= 99) 
print(num == 100)
print(num != 100)
print(num > 100 or num < 50) 
print(num > 100 and num < 50)
print(not (num > 100))

mylist = [99, 88, 77]
print(88 in mylist)

# Many python expression can resulted in boolean type when you use
# the one of comparators.

# == If/Else and If/ElseIf/Else
#
# A boolean is a condition you may use to control "while" or "if"
# code block evaluation. You learned while in details in past, but
# we will cover some more on "if" statements here.

# The basic if statment is evaluate boolean condition then execute
# block of code
import random
num = random.randint(1, 15)
if num % 2 == 0:
	print("We got a even number")
	print("More code can do here...")

# The else block is opposite of the if condition

if num % 2 == 0:
	print("We got a even number")
	print("More code can do here...")
else:
	print("We got a NOT even number")

# If you just want the else part, you just negate the if statement
 
if not (num % 2 == 0):
	print("We got a NOT even number")

# Or if just comparison with number, you can use != instead
if num % 2 != 0:
	print("We got a NOT even number")

# There is a third way to evaluate if statement, and that is
# if you have more condition to valuate that chained together.
if 0 <= num <= 3:
	print("We got a number between 0 and 3")
elif 4 <= num <=7:
	print("We got a number between 4 and 7")
elif 8 <= num <=9:
	print("We got a number between 8 and 9")
else:
	print("We got a number that does not match to other conditions")
# NOTE: Only ONE condition block will get executed! Indent correctly
#       with your code is very important!
# NOTE#2: The "elif" is spelled funny with 4 characters only. It's 
#         NOT spelled out as "elseif"!
# NOTE#3: You can one zero or more "elif"


# == Assignment Operator with If/Else
# Often we want to assign one of two possible values into a variable.
# and Python let you do this in one line statment like this.
import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
status = "PASSED" if num % == 0 else "FAILED"
print(status)
