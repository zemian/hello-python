The second part of learning programming is learning how control the data.
You have already seen that you can do basic operation on data such as 'int'
with +, -, * and /. But you can control the data in much more finner level.

Here we will explore two basic control statements that can repeat code.

# Lesson: while loop vs for loop
#
# You use while loop when you need repeat code until a condition becomes False.
#
# You use for loop when you need to repeat code for each ITEM in a list or sequence.

mylist = ['aa', 'bb']
index = 0 
while index < len(mylist):
	print(mylist[index])
	index += 1

for index in range(len(mylist)):
	print(mylist[index])

for item in mylist:
	print(item)
	
Note that uses space or tab to indent code or block of 
code. These indentations are very important to Python
code because its the only way Python can tell each begin
block and end of block. A CODE BLOCK is simple group
of one or more lines of code/statements.
	
Also in Python, we prefix "#" character to create a 
comment lines that describe the code. They are not
code and will not the executed.

# Problem: Print a sum of series numbers from 1 to 100

# Solution: Using for loop
result = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
	result += num
print(result)

# Solution: Using while loop
# NOTE: Becareful on the while condition when to stop the loop!
#       It's 100, not 101
result = 0
num = 0
while num < 100:
	num += 1
	result += num 
print(result)
