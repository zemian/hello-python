# Lesson: while loop vs for loop
#
# You use while loop when you need repeat code until a condition becomes False.
#
# You use for loop when you need to repeat code for each ITEM in a list or sequence.

# # mylist = ['aa', 'bb']
# # index = 0 
# # while index < len(mylist):
# # 	print(mylist[index])
# # 	index += 1

# # for index in range(len(mylist)):
# # 	print(mylist[index])

# # for item in mylist:
# # 	print(item)

# Problem: Print a sum of series numbers from 1 to 100

# Solution: Using for loop
# result = 0
# for num in range(1, 101):
# 	result += num
# print(result)

# Solution: Using while loop
# NOTE: Becareful on the while condition when to stop the loop!
#       It's 100, not 101
result = 0
num = 0
while num < 100:
	num += 1
	result += num 
print(result)
