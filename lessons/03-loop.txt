The second part of learning programming is learning how control the data.
You have already seen that you can do basic operation on data such as 'int'
with +, -, * and /. But you can control the data in much more finner level.

Here we will explore two basic control statements that can repeat code.

# Lesson: while loop vs for loop
#
# You use while loop when you need repeat code until a condition becomes False.
#
# You use for loop when you need to repeat code for each ITEM in a list or sequence.

mylist = ['aa', 'bb']
index = 0 
while index < len(mylist):
	print(mylist[index])
	index += 1

for index in range(len(mylist)):
	print(mylist[index])

for item in mylist:
	print(item)

# Problem: Print a sum of series numbers from 1 to 100

# Solution: Using for loop
result = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
	result += num
print(result)

# Solution: Using while loop
# NOTE: Becareful on the while condition when to stop the loop!
#       It's 100, not 101
result = 0
num = 0
while num < 100:
	num += 1
	result += num 
print(result)
