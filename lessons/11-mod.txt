# Python Lesson: Functions and Modules
#
# When you have created many functions, it's better to
# organized them into a module, or library. These can
# be distribute to other programmers to reuse your code
#
# Python has many buit-in modules!
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/

# Example using an standard built-in library module named "random"
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
print(num)

for _ in range(10):
	print(random.randint(1, 10), end=' ')
print()

# It's easy to create your own module. It turns out the file
# you save your code IS the module NAME!
#
# Example create a file named "mymodule.py" and create a function
# there like this:
def hello():
	print("Hello")
# Then in second file, you can use it as module!
import mymodule
print(mymodule.hello())

# == Exercise Assignment
# Explore the standard Python built-in modules, choose 3 modules
# and invoke one of their function and print its output.
