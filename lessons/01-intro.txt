Python is an easy to learn programming language that allows you
to do many things with computer. You can use it to modify Minecraft,
game, write new Video Games, or solve logic puzzles etc.

A programming language is needed to control the computer. In general,
a programming language allows you to write computer instructions, we 
call "code" or "program" in a specific way. Many conputer 
instructions are written to manipulate and change the data we stored to 
represents our world (or game). In many cases, we write program
to control the input/output of a device, such as a terminal console
(monitor) devide, so we can see and verify our result.

So Python program has two main things:

	Data - integer, string, list of integer or string, dictionary
	       data for key lookup, or even Objects the represents our
	       physical world! Most data are stored in a variables then
	       pass around in a program.
	Instructions - code or statements are used to control and/or 
	       manipulate the data. We use things such as for/while loop,
	       if/else condition check and skip code, function to execute
	       the code block etc.

Python let you write program code in two ways:

1) Using the python shell, which you can try out code directly
   one line at a time and see result immediately. Try:

   >>> 1 + 1

2) Save code into a file (eg: hello.py) and then run it
   with "python hello.py" on a terminal console. Try:

   print("Hello")
